#  My First KMM Application
<p>The movie application is a cross-platform mobile app built using Kotlin Multiplatform. It allows users to explore a vast collection of movies, view movie details, and stay updated with the latest releases. The app leverages the power of Kotlin Multiplatform to share common business logic and data models between the Android and iOS platforms, ensuring code reusability and minimizing development effort. With a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation, the movie application provides an immersive experience for movie enthusiasts across different devices and operating systems

I focused my investigation on two specific endpoints from The MovieDB API
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
Get All Movies Endpoint: This endpoint allows retrieving a list of all movies available in the database. It provides comprehensive information about each movie, including details such as title, release date, genre, and more. I analyzed the response structure and utilized this endpoint to fetch a complete catalog of movies for my investigation.
 </li>
  <li>
Get Movie Endpoint: This endpoint allows retrieving detailed information about a specific movie by providing its unique identifier. I used this endpoint to fetch specific movie details, such as synopsis, cast, ratings, and trailers. Analyzing the response from this endpoint helped me gather in-depth information about individual movies.
</li>
</ol>

Here, you can find the API documentation for developers on The Movie Database (TMDB). The TMDB API offers a comprehensive set of endpoints and data resources that enable developers to access a vast collection of movie-related information, including details about movies, TV shows, actors, genres, and more.
